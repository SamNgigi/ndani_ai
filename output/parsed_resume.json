    "text": "For the past five years, I’ve worked across data science, machine learning, full-stack software engineering and highly technical Salesforce development, solving complex problems and delivering impactful, scalable solutions. At PyBootcamp School, I progressed from student technical mentor to tech lead, where I implemented machine learning models that increased student retention, student NPS and built automated systems that boosted operational efficiency by over 70%, allowing revenue capture and savings of over $1.5 million dollars. I thrived in balancing technical leadership with hands-on work, from coding predictive models to optimising cloud infrastructure.",
